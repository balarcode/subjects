## Illustration of Concepts

### Mean Normalization

Mean normalization of N-dimensional dataset is implemented in the source code with insightful comments included as necessary. For simplicity, first two features (i.e. first two dimensions of the dataset) are scatter plotted to illustrate mean normalization.

### Standardization

Standardization of N-dimensional dataset is implemented in the source code with insightful comments included as necessary. For simplicity, first two features (i.e. first two dimensions of the dataset) are scatter plotted to illustrate standardization. Then, all the features containing 'N' datapoints (also known as training examples) in both original and standardized datasets are plotted for illustration. Lastly, the distribution of all features in both original and standardized datasets is illustrated.
